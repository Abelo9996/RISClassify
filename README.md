# RISClassify
A RISC-V assembly code implementation that runs a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on the Venus RISC-V simulator.

The implementation contains basic operations such as a vector dot product, matrix-matrix multiplication, the argmax and an activation function. Moreover, my implementation combines these basic functions in order to load a pretrained network and execute it to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST benchmark set.
